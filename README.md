# PERSONAL JOURNAL PROJECTS 
Hello! Welcome to my projects. 
The project involves a personal journey and experience in Web development. 
The files will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the pages. 
Some trials and errors here and there.
Unfinished pages, and Ideas that I might have. 
I just want to journal!! Yah! 
I would appreciate a comment or some cool tricks. 
Yah! #Art beyond the wall
